# tutor-tracking
The tutor tracking application will list subjects, the tutors who help with the subjects, and the
tutor's schedule for the week.
An admin for the application can add subjects, tutors, and update the schedules of tutors.
A user for the application will have the ability to view the subjects, the tutors, and the tutor's
schedules. They can view the subjects separately or as a whole. They also have the ability to make
appointments with tutors.
